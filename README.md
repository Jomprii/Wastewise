# **WasteWise – Mobile Monitoring App**


## **Description**

WasteWise is an IoT‑powered automatic waste‑sorting garbage bin system. This mobile app is designed for maintenance staff to monitor bin levels, enabling efficient waste collection. Each bin uses IR proximity sensor; when they are triggered for more than 5 seconds, the bin status is set to Full. The app refreshes the status every 3 seconds to display the current state (Empty or Full).

## **Features**

View bin status (Empty / Full) via dashboard.

Automatic updates approximately every 3 seconds based on sensor input.

Easy, intuitive interface for maintenance staff.

## **Technologies Used**

React Native

Expo Go

Django

## **Installation**
